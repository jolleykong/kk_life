# 8.0新特性

- 支持DDL原子性，都成功或都失败
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA查询性能提升（以往总是需要先访问.frm文件）并增加cache机制
- information_schema_stats_expiry控制元数据缓存失效时长，设置为0不缓存，或者ANALYZE TABLE也会更新缓存。
- 设置innodb_read_only后，就无法创建任何新表
- 手动mkdir newDB，无法被自动识别
- DDL过程涉及InnoDB引擎事务系统，会相对略慢些，但是很微小

| INFORMATION_SCHEMA | 元数据                                                       | **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** is a  database within each MySQL instance, the place that stores information about  all the other databases that the MySQL server maintains. The**INFORMATION_SCHEMA** database  contains several read-only tables. They are actually views, not base tables,  so there are no files associated with them, and you cannot set triggers on  them. Also, there is no database directory with that name.  Although you can select **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** as the default database with a [**USE**](http://sql-syntax.html) statement, you can only read  the contents of tables, not perform [**INSERT**](http://sql-syntax.html), [**UPDATE**](http://sql-syntax.html), or [**DELETE**](http://sql-syntax.html) operations on them. |

| PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA | 主要收集存储数据库服务器性能参数  主要存储数据库服务器性能参数 | The  MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution  at a low level. The Performance Schema has these characteristics:     The       Performance Schema provides a way to inspect internal execution of the       server at runtime. It is implemented using the [**PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA**](http://performance-schema.html) storage       engine and the **performance_schema** database.       The Performance Schema focuses primarily on performance data. This       differs from **INFORMATION_SCHEMA**, which       serves for inspection of metadata.   The Performance Schema       monitors server events. An “event” is anything the server does that takes time and       has been instrumented so that timing information can be collected. In       general, an event could be a function call, a wait for the operating       system, a stage of an SQL statement execution such as parsing or       sorting, or an entire statement or group of statements. Event collection       provides access to information about synchronization calls (such as for       mutexes) file and table I/O, table locks, and so forth for the server       and for several storage engines.   Performance Schema events       are distinct from events written to the server's binary log (which       describe data modifications) and Event Scheduler events (which are a       type of stored program).   Performance Schema events       are specific to a given instance of the MySQL Server. Performance Schema       tables are considered local to the server, and changes to them are not       replicated or written to the binary log.   Current events are       available, as well as event histories and summaries. This enables you to       determine how many times instrumented activities were performed and how       much time they took. Event information is available to show the       activities of specific threads, or activity associated with particular       objects such as a mutex or file.   The [**PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA**](http://performance-schema.html) storage       engine collects event data using “instrumentation points” in       server source code.   Collected       events are stored in tables in the **performance_schema** database. These tables can       be queried using [**SELECT**](http://sql-syntax.html) statements like other tables.   Performance       Schema configuration can be modified dynamically by updating tables in       the **performance_schema** database       through SQL statements. Configuration changes affect data collection       immediately.   Tables in the Performance       Schema are in-memory tables that use no persistent on-disk storage. The       contents are repopulated beginning at server startup and discarded at       server shutdown.   Monitoring is       available on all platforms supported by MySQL.               Some limitations might apply: The types of timers might vary per       platform. Instruments that apply to storage engines might not be       implemented for all storage engines. Instrumentation of each third-party       engine is the responsibility of the engine maintainer. See also[Section C.8, “Restrictions on Performance Schema”](http://restrictions.html).   Data collection is       implemented by modifying the server source code to add instrumentation.       There are no separate threads associated with the Performance Schema,       unlike other features such as replication or the Event Scheduler.    The Performance Schema is intended to provide access to useful  information about server execution while having minimal impact on server  performance. The implementation follows these design goals:     Activating       the Performance Schema causes no changes in server behavior. For       example, it does not cause thread scheduling to change, and it does not       cause query execution plans (as shown by [**EXPLAIN**](http://sql-syntax.html)) to change.   Server monitoring occurs       continuously and unobtrusively with very little overhead. Activating the       Performance Schema does not make the server unusable.   The parser is unchanged.       There are no new keywords or statements.   Execution of server code       proceeds normally even if the Performance Schema fails internally.   When there is a choice       between performing processing during event collection initially or       during event retrieval later, priority is given to making collection       faster. This is because collection is ongoing whereas retrieval is on       demand and might never happen at all.   Most       Performance Schema tables have indexes, which gives the optimizer access       to execution plans other than full table scans. For more information,       see [Section 8.2.4,        “Optimizing Performance Schema Queries”](http://optimization.html).   It is easy to add new       instrumentation points.   Instrumentation is       versioned. If the instrumentation implementation changes, previously       instrumented code will continue to work. This benefits developers of       third-party plugins because it is not necessary to upgrade each plugin       to stay synchronized with the latest Performance Schema changes.    **Note**  The MySQL **sys** schema is a set of objects that provides convenient access  to data collected by the Performance Schema. The **sys** schema is installed by default. For usage  instructions, see [Chapter 27, *MySQL sys   Schema*](http://sys-schema.html). |
| sys                |                                                              | MySQL 8.0 includes the [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema, a set of objects that  helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance  Schema. [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema  objects can be used for typical tuning and diagnosis use cases. Objects in  this schema include:     Views that summarize       Performance Schema data into more easily understandable form.   Stored procedures that       perform operations such as Performance Schema configuration and       generating diagnostic reports.   Stored functions that       query Performance Schema configuration and provide formatting services.    For new installations, the [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema is installed by default  during data directory initialization if you use [**mysqld**](http://programs.html) with the [--initialize](http://server-administration.html) or [--initialize-insecure](http://server-administration.html) option. If  this is not desired, you can drop the [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema manually after  initialization if it is unneeded.  The MySQL upgrade procedure produces an error  if a [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema  exists but has no [**version**](http://sys-schema.html)view, on the assumption that absence of this  view indicates a user-created **sys** schema. To  upgrade in this case, remove or rename the existing [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema first.  [**sys**](http://sys-schema.html) schema objects have a **DEFINER** of **'mysql.sys'@'localhost'**. Use of the dedicated**mysql.sys** account avoids problems that  occur if a DBA renames or removes the **root** account. |

Data  dictionary tables are located in the mysql database  together with non-data dictionary system tables.  Data dictionary tables are created in a single **InnoDB** tablespace named mysql.ibd, which resides in the MySQL data directory. The mysql.ibd tablespace file must reside in the MySQL data directory  and its name cannot be modified or used by another tablespace.  Dictionary data is protected by the same commit, rollback, and  crash-recovery capabilities that protect user data that is stored in **InnoDB** tables. |
