> The [`SELECT ... INTO`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select-into) form of [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) enables a query result to be stored in variables or written to a file:
>
> - `SELECT ... INTO *`var_list`*` selects column values and stores them into variables.
> - `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` writes the selected rows to a file. Column and line terminators can be specified to produce a specific output format.
> - `SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE` writes a single row to a file without any formatting.
>
> A given [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) statement can contain at most one `INTO` clause, although as shown by the [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) syntax description (see [Section 13.2.10, “SELECT Statement”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select)), the `INTO` can appear in different positions:
>
> - Before `FROM`. Example:
>
>   ```
>   SELECT * INTO @myvar FROM t1;
>   ```
>
> - Before a trailing locking clause. Example:
>
>   ```
>   SELECT * FROM t1 INTO @myvar FOR UPDATE;
>   ```
>
> - At the end of the [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select). Example:
>
>   ```
>   SELECT * FROM t1 FOR UPDATE INTO @myvar;
>   ```
>
> The `INTO` position at the end of the statement is supported as of MySQL 8.0.20, and is the preferred position. The position before a locking clause is deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.20 and support for it will be removed in a future MySQL version. In other words, `INTO` after `FROM` but not at the end of the [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) produces a warning.
>
> An `INTO` clause should not be used in a nested [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) because such a [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) must return its result to the outer context. There are also constraints on the use of `INTO` within [`UNION`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#union) statements; see [Section 13.2.10.3, “UNION Clause”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#union).
>
> For the `INTO *`var_list`*` variant:
>
> - *`var_list`* names a list of one or more variables, each of which can be a user-defined variable, stored procedure or function parameter, or stored program local variable. (Within a prepared `SELECT ... INTO *`var_list`*`statement, only user-defined variables are permitted; see [Section 13.6.4.2, “Local Variable Scope and Resolution”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#local-variable-scope).)
>
> - The selected values are assigned to the variables. The number of variables must match the number of columns. The query should return a single row. If the query returns no rows, a warning with error code 1329 occurs (`No data`), and the variable values remain unchanged. If the query returns multiple rows, error 1172 occurs (`Result consisted of more than one row`). If it is possible that the statement may retrieve multiple rows, you can use `LIMIT 1` to limit the result set to a single row.
>
>   ```
>   SELECT id, data INTO @x, @y FROM test.t1 LIMIT 1;
>   ```
>
> 
>
> `INTO *`var_list`*` can also be used with a [`TABLE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#table) statement, subject to these restrictions:
>
> - The number of variables must match the number of columns in the table.
> - If the table contains more than one row, you must use `LIMIT 1` to limit the result set to a single row. `LIMIT 1`must precede the `INTO` keyword.
>
> An example of such a statement is shown here:
>
> ```
> TABLE employees ORDER BY lname DESC LIMIT 1 
>     INTO @id, @fname, @lname, @hired, @separated, @job_code, @store_id;
> ```
>
> 
>
> You can also select values from a [`VALUES`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#values) statement that generates a single row into a set of user variables. In this case, you must employ a table alias, and you must assign each value from the value list to a variable. Each of the two statements shown here is equivalent to [`SET @x=2, @y=4, @z=8`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#set-variable):
>
> ```
> SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(2,4,8)) AS t INTO @x,@y,@z;
> 
> SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(2,4,8)) AS t(a,b,c) INTO @x,@y,@z;
> ```

> The [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '*`file_name`*'`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select-into) form of [`SELECT`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select) writes the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server host, so you must have the [`FILE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/security.html#priv_file) privilege to use this syntax. *`file_name`* cannot be an existing file, which among other things prevents files such as `/etc/passwd` and database tables from being modified. The [`character_set_filesystem`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/server-administration.html#sysvar_character_set_filesystem) system variable controls the interpretation of the file name.
>
> The [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select-into) statement is intended to enable dumping a table to a text file on the server host. To create the resulting file on some other host, [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select-into) normally is unsuitable because there is no way to write a path to the file relative to the server host file system, unless the location of the file on the remote host can be accessed using a network-mapped path on the server host file system.
>
> Alternatively, if the MySQL client software is installed on the remote host, you can use a client command such as `mysql -e "SELECT ..." > *`file_name`*` to generate the file on that host.
>
> [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#select-into) is the complement of [`LOAD DATA`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#load-data). Column values are written converted to the character set specified in the `CHARACTER SET` clause. If no such clause is present, values are dumped using the `binary` character set. In effect, there is no character set conversion. If a result set contains columns in several character sets, so will the output data file and it may not be possible to reload the file correctly.
>
> The syntax for the *`export_options`* part of the statement consists of the same `FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses that are used with the [`LOAD DATA`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#load-data) statement. For information about the `FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses, including their default values and permissible values, see [Section 13.2.7, “LOAD DATA Statement”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#load-data).
>
> `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` controls how to write special characters. If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is not empty, it is used when necessary to avoid ambiguity as a prefix that precedes following characters on output:
>
> - The `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character
> - The `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` character
> - The first character of the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `LINES TERMINATED BY` values
> - ASCII `NUL` (the zero-valued byte; what is actually written following the escape character is ASCII `0`, not a zero-valued byte)
>
> The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`, `ENCLOSED BY`, `ESCAPED BY`, or `LINES TERMINATED BY` characters *must* be escaped so that you can read the file back in reliably. ASCII `NUL` is escaped to make it easier to view with some pagers.
>
> The resulting file need not conform to SQL syntax, so nothing else need be escaped.
>
> If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is empty, no characters are escaped and `NULL` is output as `NULL`, not `\N`. It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character, particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters in the list just given.
>
> 
>
> `INTO OUTFILE` can also be used with a [`TABLE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#table) statement when you want to dump all columns of a table into a text file. In this case, the ordering and number of rows can be controlled using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`; these clauses must precede `INTO OUTFILE`. `TABLE ... INTO OUTFILE` supports the same *`export_options`* as does `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`, and it is subject to the same restrictions on writing to the file system. An example of such a statement is shown here:
>
> ```
> TABLE employees ORDER BY lname LIMIT 1000
>     INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/employee_data_1.txt'
>     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"', ESCAPED BY '\'
>     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
> ```
>
> You can also use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` with a [`VALUES`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#values) statement to write values directly into a file. An example is shown here:
>
> ```
> SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW(1,2,3),ROW(4,5,6),ROW(7,8,9)) AS t 
>     INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/select-values.txt';
> ```
>
> You must use a table alias; column aliases are also supported, and can optionally be used to write values only from desired columns. You can also use any or all of the export options supported by `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` to format the output to the file.
>
> 
>
> Here is an example that produces a file in the comma-separated values (CSV) format used by many programs:
>
> ```
> SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.txt'
>   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
>   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
>   FROM test_table;
> ```
>
> 
>
> If you use `INTO DUMPFILE` instead of `INTO OUTFILE`, MySQL writes only one row into the file, without any column or line termination and without performing any escape processing. This is useful for selecting a [`BLOB`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/data-types.html#blob) value and storing it in a file.
>
> [`TABLE`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#table) also supports `INTO DUMPFILE`. If the table contains more than one row, you must also use `LIMIT 1` to limit the output to a single row. `INTO DUMPFILE` can also be used with `SELECT * FROM (VALUES ROW()[, ...]) AS*`table_alias`* [LIMIT 1]`. See [Section 13.2.14, “VALUES Statement”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-statements.html#values).
>
> Note
>
> Any file created by `INTO OUTFILE` or `INTO DUMPFILE` is owned by the operating system user under whose account [**mysqld**](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/programs.html#mysqld) runs. (You should *never* run [**mysqld**](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/programs.html#mysqld) as `root` for this and other reasons.) As of MySQL 8.0.17, the umask for file creation is 0640; you must have sufficient access privileges to manipulate the file contents. Prior to MySQL 8.0.17, the umask is 0666 and the file is writable by all users on the server host.
>
> If the [`secure_file_priv`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/MySQL/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/server-administration.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system variable is set to a nonempty directory name, the file to be written must be located in that directory.

Most options to[**mysqlimport**](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/Versioned DocSets/MySQL - DHDocsetDownloader/5-7/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/programs.html#mysqlimport) correspond directly to clauses of [`LOAD DATA`](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/Versioned DocSets/MySQL - DHDocsetDownloader/5-7/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-syntax.html#load-data) syntax. See [Section 13.2.6, “LOAD DATA Syntax”](dfile:///Users/kk/Library/Application Support/Dash/Versioned DocSets/MySQL - DHDocsetDownloader/5-7/MySQL.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/sql-syntax.html#load-data).
